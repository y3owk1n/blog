Hey there! I'm a 31-year-old technology enthusiast who's currently single. I have a real passion for combining marketing and technology to create amazing experiences that drive results. Over the past six years, I've been working in the data-driven Growth and Digital Marketing world, and I've helped to drive revenue growth across a range of industries. Most recently, I've been working with&nbsp;[**Traworld**](https://www.traworld.com/), a fast-growing Malaysia-based Travel E-Commerce startup.

My approach to marketing is to take a full-funnel and holistic view of things. I use marketing technology, automation, and analytics to optimize the customer experience throughout their entire lifecycle. This allows me to deliver 1:1 hyper-personalized campaigns at scale.

As part of my work, I lead the marketing team that's focused on driving incremental and continual improvements. We're always experimenting to improve key metrics like LTV, CAC, ROAS, Products Per Customer, Retention, and more. It's a challenging and exciting field, and I love every minute of it!

When I'm not working, I'm usually indulging in my creative pursuits. I'm really passionate about music, singing, and programming.

There's something about building for the web that I find incredibly rewarding. Whether it's starting with a simple HTML file or working on a complex Next.js application, there's always a sense of excitement and possibility. That's because the web is such an amazing platform.
