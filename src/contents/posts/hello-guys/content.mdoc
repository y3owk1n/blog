> *Decided to re-activate my blog site.*

Hi, I'm Kyle. I've left this blog untouched for almost a year, but I'm re-activating it. Meanwhile, I decided to move my blog to a&nbsp;[**Next.js**](https://nextjs.org/)&nbsp;site.

I am just so lazy to code the whole blog, and I decided to bootstrap the blog using&nbsp;[**Blog Starter Template From Nextjs**](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog-starter)&nbsp;with some tiny CSS changes around the blog.

Honestly, nothing really fancy, but for now, I am looking to start writing more about what I do and like - mainly about digital marketing, programming or even some random things that I have yet to know about.
