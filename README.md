## A place for me to write and store most information that i need

Hi, I'm Kyle. I've left this blog untouched for almost a year, but I'm re-activating it. Meanwhile, I decided to move my blog to a Next.js site.

Honestly, nothing really fancy, but for now, I am looking to start writing more about what I do and like - mainly about digital marketing, programming or even some random things that I have yet to know about.
